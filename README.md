# employee-tracker

## Description

I built this project to help non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. This project was made to be a user-friendly interface. This allows any business owner to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in thier company so that they can be organized and have a structured business. In order to build this project I had to apply new skill sets that I've learned throughout the module. This is what motivated me in creating this project, to see it come to life and be beneficial to every business owner. This content management system was built to be a understable interface to manage. The user, business owner, would have to input "npm run start in the command line to get the application to initiate. The user would then be prompted with a set of options to select from to manage the database, for example: to view all employees, add employee, view all roles, and view all departments. If user was to select view all employees, they would be presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to. The user would be prompted to original options after each action taken. They can even process to add employees if sleceted. They would be prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database. And such as they can even select to update the employees role when prompted again what option they'd like to select. If user decides no more actions is need to manage or organize the database, they can simply select "Quit", and the application will close. In order to build this project I had to apply some new skills sets to have it fucntioning properly. For ths project I learned how to use node.js and the following npm's, Inquirer and MySQL. These packages allowed me to create my schema's needed to create the database as well as the tables. I was able to generate the seeds needs to pre-populate the database. I learned how to set primary keys as well as foreign keys and refrence them correctly. By using MySQL2 package it allowed us to connect to the  MySQL database and perform queries, and the Inquirer packageLinks allowed us to interact with the user via the command line.
With these skills applied I was able to get this project to operate as it should. It was a great experience to create a command-line application using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
